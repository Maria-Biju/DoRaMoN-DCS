How you started

How your thinking evolved:

The system uses a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach based on a normalized weighted scoring model.
This method was selected because it provides transparent, explainable recommendations while supporting dynamic criteria and weights.
Alternative algorithms such as AHP and TOPSIS were considered but were not chosen for the MVP due to higher complexity and reduced explainability for end users.

Alternative approaches considered:
->“The system is designed to optionally integrate external data sources in the future. However, for transparency and explainability, this implementation relies on user-provided structured inputs.”
